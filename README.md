Tuberculosis Prediction is an offline mobile application that is created to assist doctors in rural areas of Nepal that have limited access to resources and distant Tuberculosis Hospitals.
This is my final year project where I researched about Tuberculosis in Nepal and how a TB prediction application can assist doctors in rural areas. The model was trained using Teachable Machine.

## Tuberculosis Prediction:
The application predicts and gives three different outputs : 
- **Tuberculosis**: If the model predicts Tuberculosis with more than 80% accuracy.
- **No Tuberculosis**: If the model predicts No Tuberculosis with more than 80% accuracy.
- **Failed to Recognize**: If the model predicts Tuberculosis / No Tuberculosis with less than 80% accuracy.
