# Tuberculosis Prediction Application



Tuberculosis Prediction is an offline mobile application that is created to assist doctors in rural areas of Nepal that have limited access to resources and distant Tuberculosis Hospitals.
This is my final year project where I researched about Tuberculosis in Nepal and how a TB prediction application can assist doctors in rural areas.
